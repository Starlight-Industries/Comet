## What is Comet?

Comet is a platform agnostic, automatically declarative package manager purpose built to simplify the needs of both developers and new users alike.
It tries to providing a versatile, fast, and capable alterntive to other monolthic

## Why?

Comet aims to provide:

* Automatic logging and managing of package configurations
* multi-source fetching (eg. git, self hosted repos, the comet Mono-repo)
* Easy integration for other managers, (see npm for example)
* Reduced reliance on complex package ecosystems (such as pip + conda)

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -f https://comet.starlight.rs/get | sh
```

After installation, Comet will be available in your `$PATH`. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
comet --version
```

> 💡 if comet cannot be found make sure it is in your $PATH and restart your shell
